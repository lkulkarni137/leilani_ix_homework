                        I am an incoming second-year at Northwestern University's school of
                        engineering studying Computer Science. I'm originally from Chicago, IL
                        and have lived there all my life, so I'm excited to live in a new country
                        for a bit this summer! In school, I'm part of the women in computing club, Engineers
                        for a Sustainable World, and SASA (South Asian Student Association). Outside of school,
                        I play the piano, run, and love reading and spending time with my friends. I also love
                        traveling, exploring new cultures, and trying new food, so I'm so excited for Lisbon!
                    </p>

                    <p id="p3" class="font"> I look forward to meeting everyone! </p>
